Changelog
=========

1.0b1 (unreleased)
------------------

-  Move styles and scripts into the viewlet, so that they are included when using Diazo and just using the viewlet selector to copy the viewlet into the theme.
  [thet]

- Add "OK" and "Cancel" buttons instead of the close link.
  Both buttons close the viewlet but the storage key is only set when hitting OK.
  Previously the storage key was immediately set even without using the "close" link.
