Installation
------------

To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:

Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following to it:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.disclaimer

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.

Check the box next to 'Disclaimer' and click the 'Activate' button.
